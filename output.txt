prefix_result.dat

each line corresponds to 1 strong lens system

1: number of images
2: lens redshift
3: velocity dispersion [km/s]
4: source redshift
5: original source i-band magnitude
6: i-band magnitude of lensed image (fainter image for double and 3rd brightest image for quad)
7: image separation [arcsec]
8: lens ellipticity
9: lens position angle [deg]
10: external shear
11: external shear position angle [deg]
12: source x [arcsec]
13: source y [arcsec]
14: flag_type, 0 for lensed quasar,  1 for Ia, 2 for Ibc, 3 for IIP, 4 for IIL, 5 for IIn
15: lens galaxy ID

-----------------------
prefix_log.dat

each lens system consist of following unit
lenses are listed in the same order as in mock_qso_result.dat

N=num_image x_src y_src flag_type lens_id
 x_img[1] y_img[1] mag[1] delay[1]  kappa[1] gamma1[1] gamma2[1]
 ...
 x_img[N] y_img[N] mag[N] delay[N]  kappa[N] gamma1[N] gamma2[N]

time delays are in units of days

-----------------------
prefix.fits

fits table that contains results in prefix_result.dat and prefix_log.dat
the format (parameter names) is similar to the one used in OM10
