# gen_mock_om10p

A python code to generate mock catalogs of gravitationally lensed quasars and supernovae. The code was originally developed in [Oguri & Marshall (2010)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.405.2579O/abstract) and was written in C. The code in this repository is the version rewritten in python and includes several minor updates presented in e.g., [Oguri (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.480.3842O/abstract), [Lemon et al. (2022)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220607714L/abstract), and [Shen et al. (2022)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220804979S/abstract).

## Requirement

This code uses [glafic](https://github.com/oguri/glafic2) and [lenstronomy](https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronomy) as lens equation solvers. Both these python modules need to be installed before running this code.

## Examples

The full (1 realization) LSST quasar lens mock catalog is generated by
```
./gen_mock_om10p.py --area=20000.0 --ilim=23.3 --zlmax=3.0 --source=qso --prefix=qso_mock --solver=glafic
```
The full (1 realization) LSST supernova lens mock catalog is generated by
```
./gen_mock_om10p.py --area=50000.0 --ilim=22.6 --zlmax=2.0 --source=sn --prefix=sne_mock --solver=glafic
```
